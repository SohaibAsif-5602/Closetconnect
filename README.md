# A Study in Human Computer Interaction in a clothing E-commerce experience

This e-commerce system combines three interfaces to create a user-friendly online fashion store shopping experience: a React app used to build a webpage interface for browsing on computers, a React Native used to build a mobile app interface for on-the-go shopping, both of these interfaces are backed by Firebase, our database interface. 
It simply allows users to browse products, view product details, add the desired items to the cart, and complete the checkout process.


# Getting Started

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following key dependencies:
- React: A popular JavaScript library for developing user interfaces. This framework follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state and rendering of those components.
- React Native: A framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- Expo: A platform for building and deploying React Native apps.
- Firebase: A backend platform for mobile app interface and web-app interface, providing authentication, database, and storage services.

## Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to configure the database. To do so you have to set up a Firebase project and obtain the necessary configuration files and API keys.

## Known Issues

The application may not work correctly with older versions of Expo. Make sure to use the specified version of Expo Go app (2.28.6) for optimal compatibility.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


## FIREBASE DATABASE INTERFACE

One of the interfaces of our e-commerce system is the Firebase database, which serves as the backend for storing and managing data. 
Firebase is a great platform provided by Google that offers a bunch of tools and services for building web and mobile applications.

As my project is mostly front-end based that requires minimal back-end work I have chosen Firebase for my project because it's super easy to use, provides real-time data synchronisation, and integrates easily with React and React Native.

**Key Features of Firebase Database:**

1. Real-time Data Synchronisation: It enables real-time data synchronisation across all connected devices. Any changes made to the data are instantly updated and reflected in the application, giving users a smooth experience.

2. Scalability and Performance: Firebase is built to handle large-scale applications with tons of traffic and data usage.

3. Security and Authentication: Firebase takes security seriously and offers robust features to keep your app and data safe. It supports various authentication methods, like email/password, Google Sign-In, making sure only authorised users can access the application.

**Troubleshooting and Safety Measures:**

1. Continuous Operation: One thing to keep in mind is that if you leave the Firebase database open for a long time, it might stop working. To prevent this, make sure to close the database connection when you're not using it and have proper error handling in place.

2. Security Rules: Firebase has these cool security rules that let you control who can read and write to your database. It's super important to set these rules correctly to prevent any unauthorised access and keep your data safe. Make sure to review and update the security rules regularly to stay one step ahead of any potential vulnerabilities.

3. Authentication Data Protection: To keep your authentication data safe from bad cookies and unauthorised access, it's a good idea to regularly edit the Firebase rules.

**Frequent Issues encountered:**
My localhost http://localhost:19007 stopped working due to a 'FirebaseError: Quota exceeded error in product.js:12'. This error indicates that the Firebase quota limit has been reached, and further requests cannot be processed until the quota resets or is increased.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:
1. Check your Firebase plan and quota limits to see if you have exceeded the allowed usage.
2. Optimise your database queries and reduce unnecessary reads and writes to minimise quota consumption.
3. Consider upgrading your Firebase plan to a higher tier with increased quota limits if necessary.
4. Reach out to Firebase support for further assistance if the issue persists.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


## We hope you enjoy using the Online Fashion Store application created. Happy shopping!
